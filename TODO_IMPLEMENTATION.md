## City Blurbs:
- **Chengdu**: I was born in Chengdu and I visit during the summers because my grandparents live there.
- **Beijing**: I spent most of my childhood in Beijing where I was homeschooled rather than going to kindergarten. This was also when I first developed my interest for science.
- **Toronto**: I moved to Toronto when I was 6 and I've been living here ever since.
