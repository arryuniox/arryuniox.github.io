alright twins this is my very amazing portfolio (top 10 lies of all time, it is dogshit)

we're using vite and react.js for this very amazing portfolio and it looks half decent

TODO:
- make the other pages look as alive as the home page
- low quality mode or smth so that it doesnt fry sm poor guy's unc status device
- more human aspects of me (spotify songs, albums, and artists; goodreads/book list; something interactive i guess)
- make some stuff more obvious/front and center
- rework the layout on other pages so it looks and feels more comfortable
- actually write something new for the blog ðŸ˜­
